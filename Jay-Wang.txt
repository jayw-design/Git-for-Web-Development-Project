Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
Block element starts on a new line and takes the entire width, inline element doesn't start on a new line and only takes as much space as needed.

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
That element will have a permanent location on the page and won't be responsive to the change of canvas size etc.

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
By defining the margins in a declaration in css and apply said definition in HTML.

4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
<h1>, <p>, <dt>; 
<img>, <span>; 
<a>.

5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
The box model defines the position of a certain element on the webpage, the fix to it is to make it responsive by adjust value in paddings.
